# GA_Parameter_Testing
Python code used to test the performance of a genetic algorithm used to solve a mock power distribution planning problem.

Thesis Abstract

Power Distribution Planning is a complex task that involves the consideration of many
factors. Researchers that used genetic algorithms to plan distribution networks have
mostly chosen parameter settings in an experimental fashion which implies a need for a
problem-specific recommendation. A literature review was conducted on the use of genetic
algorithms in Power Distribution Planning and the latest trends in parameter setting and
a set of high performing and easy-to-implement techniques were selected to be evaluated.
Using a generalised problem formulation, adaptive parameter setting techniques were
compared to fixed parameter settings using real power distribution data from the Perth
Metropolitan distribution network. The parameter settings were compared using the t-test
with mutually exclusive parameter variations. The results confirmed that many of the
parameter settings implemented in a wider context perform well on power distribution
problems. Population size was found to be the most significant parameter tested whilst
crossover probability was found to have insignificant effects on performance.
